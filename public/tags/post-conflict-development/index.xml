      <description>While macro-level analyses have greatly contributed to our understanding of post-conflict peacebuilding, a macro-only approach entails serious shortcomings. These include a potential mismatch between theoretical mechanisms and empirical data, and a failure to take into account the attitudes of citizens towards peace, problems that may mean only superficially relevant knowledge is produced for practitioners. Addressing this issue, we take up the idea of the &amp;lsquo;micro-level&amp;rsquo; as a conceptual and empirical distinction that breaks up the territorial state or dyads as levels of analysis in favor of lower-level units of analysis, such as individuals, sub-groups, or geographical regions.</description>

      <description>The changing UN presence in Haiti opens up a window of opportunity to explore the social geography of this post-disaster country. After the withdrawal of MINUSTAH in April 2017, the UN has established a smaller peace mission, the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH). The missionâ€™s leadership is currently reviewing the specific delimitation of security zones, with the objective to shrink the yellow zone to a smaller, more targeted area.</description>

      <description>How can peace best be promoted following civil war? The transition from violent internal conflict to peace arguably is one of the most difficult challenges a society can face. Although a small number of countries has managed to prevent renewed civil war, others are often caught in &amp;lsquo;conflict traps&amp;rsquo;. Of those countries that have managed to prevent a relapse into full-scale war, many are characterized by high violent crime rates, illicit economies, corruption, violent protests, or simmering non-state conflicts between armed militias in the periphery, rendering the &amp;lsquo;quality&amp;rsquo; of the post-conflict peace poor, at best.</description>

      <title>The Political Economy of Power-Sharing</title>

      <description>How does power-sharing affect resource allocation between elites and constituencies in post-conflict situations? The question if and how power-sharing arrangements between a state government and former rebel groups actually change the distribution and exercise of political power in a post-conflict situation is rarely investigated. In this project, we argue that the type of power-sharing affects sub-national resource allocation patterns. Power-sharing provides an opportunity for former conflict actors to access state resources and distribute those resources strategically to their constituencies.</description>
