      <description>The Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) contains information on the promises and practices of power-sharing between governments and rebels for a five-year period after the conclusion of a peace agreement (unless violence recurred earlier). The main features of this dataset are the specific focus on government-rebel dyads during post-conflict periods, an exact temporal mapping of implemented or abolished power-sharing events, and detailed descriptions for each power-sharing arrangement put into practice. This codebook describes the definitions of core concepts and operationalization of variables in this data collection.</description>

      <title>Rebel Organization and Violence Against Civilians</title>

      <description>This has been my PhD project which I completed in 2012 at the University of Nottingham. In my thesis, I examine the relationship between rebel organisation and violence against civilians in sub-Saharan Africa. I argue that rebels use such one-sided violence to enforce popular support when they are unable to secure support otherwise. An important determinant of this strategic use of violence is the rebels&amp;rsquo; organisational configuration. Organisational factors such as the ideology of a rebel group, the occurrence of leadership divisions, the level of fractionalisation within a rebel group&amp;rsquo;s population base, the existence of external support and the number of competing rebel factions determine whether non-violent strategies to secure support are available or whether rebels can only rely on violent means to enforce support.</description>
