      <description>While macro-level analyses have greatly contributed to our understanding of post-conflict peacebuilding, a macro-only approach entails serious shortcomings. These include a potential mismatch between theoretical mechanisms and empirical data, and a failure to take into account the attitudes of citizens towards peace, problems that may mean only superficially relevant knowledge is produced for practitioners. Addressing this issue, we take up the idea of the &amp;lsquo;micro-level&amp;rsquo; as a conceptual and empirical distinction that breaks up the territorial state or dyads as levels of analysis in favor of lower-level units of analysis, such as individuals, sub-groups, or geographical regions.</description>

      <title>UN Security Zones and the Social Geography of Port-au-Prince</title>

      <description>The changing UN presence in Haiti opens up a window of opportunity to explore the social geography of this post-disaster country. After the withdrawal of MINUSTAH in April 2017, the UN has established a smaller peace mission, the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH). The missionâ€™s leadership is currently reviewing the specific delimitation of security zones, with the objective to shrink the yellow zone to a smaller, more targeted area.</description>

      <title>The Political Economy of Power-Sharing</title>

      <description>How does power-sharing affect resource allocation between elites and constituencies in post-conflict situations? The question if and how power-sharing arrangements between a state government and former rebel groups actually change the distribution and exercise of political power in a post-conflict situation is rarely investigated. In this project, we argue that the type of power-sharing affects sub-national resource allocation patterns. Power-sharing provides an opportunity for former conflict actors to access state resources and distribute those resources strategically to their constituencies.</description>

      <title>Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED)</title>

      <description>The Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) contains information on the promises and practices of power-sharing between governments and rebels for a five-year period after the conclusion of a peace agreement (unless violence recurred earlier). The main features of this dataset are the specific focus on government-rebel dyads during post-conflict periods, an exact temporal mapping of implemented or abolished power-sharing events, and detailed descriptions for each power-sharing arrangement put into practice. This codebook describes the definitions of core concepts and operationalization of variables in this data collection.</description>

      <title>Rebel Organization and Violence Against Civilians</title>

      <description>This has been my PhD project which I completed in 2012 at the University of Nottingham. In my thesis, I examine the relationship between rebel organisation and violence against civilians in sub-Saharan Africa. I argue that rebels use such one-sided violence to enforce popular support when they are unable to secure support otherwise. An important determinant of this strategic use of violence is the rebels&amp;rsquo; organisational configuration. Organisational factors such as the ideology of a rebel group, the occurrence of leadership divisions, the level of fractionalisation within a rebel group&amp;rsquo;s population base, the existence of external support and the number of competing rebel factions determine whether non-violent strategies to secure support are available or whether rebels can only rely on violent means to enforce support.</description>
