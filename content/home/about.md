# About me

I work on post-conflict power-sharing and the political economy of civil war and development. My objective is to understand the effects of conflict resolution efforts and post-conflict reconstruction on political order and society. Ongoing projects explore resource redistribution, political trust, and contentious politics after civil war. 

I also coordinate the [Citizens in Peace Processes (CIPP)](https://sites.google.com/view/citizensinpeaceprocesses/) research network. This network advances our understanding of the role citizens play in shaping the potential for and nature of the peace following civil wars. It facilitates scholarship and knowledge exchange to inform practitioners supporting citizen engagement in peace processes.
