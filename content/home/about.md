# About me

I work on the political economy of post-conflict institutions and development. My objective is to understand when and under what conditions positive peace is possible after civil war. Ongoing projects explore the redistributive effects of power-sharing and the role of citizens in peace processes.

Focusing on design-based inference, I rely on the combination of advanced statistical research methods and qualitative field research. I have worked in Indonesia and Liberia.

I am a Birmingham Fellow in International Security at the University of Birmingham. Recent work has appeared in Conflict Management & Peace Science and World Development.
