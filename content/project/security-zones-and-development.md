Every international intervention comes with its own security regulations, which contribute in turn to structure the political geography of the intervention, delimiting areas of interaction between interveners and local population and shaping the political economy of intervention. We argue that these security regulations can have a substantial impact on the political and economic development of post-conflict/post-disaster countries.

This project will commence in September 2019 in collaboration with [Nicolas Lemay-HÃ©bert](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government-society/departments/international-development/staff/profiles/lemay-hebert-nicolas.aspx) and [David Hudson](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government-society/departments/international-development/staff/profiles/hudson-david.aspx). Seed funding has been provided under the 'Resilient Cities' theme of the University of Birmingham's [Institute for Global Innovation](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/global-goals/igi/index.aspx).
